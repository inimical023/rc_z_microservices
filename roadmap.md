# RingCentral-Zoho Integration Roadmap

This roadmap outlines key improvements and implementation steps for the RingCentral-Zoho integration project.

## Recommended Improvements

### 1. Environment Variable Configuration

**Priority:** High  
**Difficulty:** Medium  
**Reason:** Eliminates file path resolution issues and aligns with container best practices

**Implementation Details:**
- Add support for loading all configuration from environment variables
- Create a hierarchical naming convention (e.g., `ZOHO_CLIENT_ID`, `RABBITMQ_HOST`)
- Maintain backward compatibility with config.json
- Use environment variables as the primary source with config.json as fallback
- Leverage `python-dotenv` for local development
- Update shared/config.py to support this hybrid approach

**Benefits:**
- Eliminates config file path issues in containerized environments
- Improves security by keeping credentials outside of version control
- Provides flexibility across different deployment environments
- Follows container best practices

### 2. Enhanced Health Checks

**Priority:** High  
**Difficulty:** Medium  
**Reason:** Enables proper orchestration and early problem detection

**Implementation Details:**
- Implement separate liveness and readiness probe endpoints for Kubernetes compatibility
- Add deep health checks for all service dependencies:
  - RabbitMQ connectivity
  - Zoho API token validation
  - RingCentral API token validation
  - Inter-service connectivity
- Include detailed health status with service uptime, connection states, and resource usage
- Add a health check dashboard to the admin interface

**Benefits:**
- Supports proper orchestration in Kubernetes
- Detects dependency issues before they cause cascading failures
- Provides early warnings for API connection problems
- Simplifies debugging of connectivity issues

### 3. Centralized Logging

**Priority:** Medium  
**Difficulty:** High  
**Reason:** Critical for debugging distributed systems

**Implementation Details:**
- Implement structured JSON logging across all services
- Add correlation IDs to track requests across services
- Set up a centralized logging stack (ELK, Fluentd, or similar)
- Include contextual information in all logs (service name, environment, etc.)
- Add log aggregation to the Docker Compose setup
- Create log retention and rotation policies

**Benefits:**
- Makes it easier to debug issues across multiple services
- Enables correlation of events between services
- Improves observability of the entire system
- Facilitates troubleshooting of production issues

### 4. Improved Documentation

**Priority:** Medium  
**Difficulty:** Low  
**Reason:** Ensures smooth onboarding and maintenance

**Implementation Details:**
- Update README.md with new configuration approaches
- Add troubleshooting guidelines based on recent fixes
- Document the config discovery process and fallback strategies
- Create architecture diagrams showing service interactions
- Add deployment guides for different environments
- Include API documentation for internal service endpoints

**Benefits:**
- Reduces onboarding time for new developers
- Provides clear guidelines for deployment and maintenance
- Helps troubleshoot common issues quickly
- Preserves institutional knowledge
